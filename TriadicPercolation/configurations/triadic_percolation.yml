# A brief description of the parameters in the file
#      c: Average structural degree of the Poisson network
#      cp: Average positive regulatory degree of the Poisson regulatory network
#      cn: Average negative regulatory degree of the Poisson regulatory network
#      Tmax: max duration of the dynamic
#      num: Number of samples used to plot the orbit diagram

# The parameters show the orbit diagram of percolation on networks with positive and negative triadic interactions.
